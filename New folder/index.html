                <h2>CLARK</h2>
                <P>I am Kenneth John Clark L. Briones 21 years of age and I am a USTP student in the course BSIT and I am apparently 2nd year
                    I would describe myself my self now in four different parts. I would describe myself as a kind, generous and helpful person. I love to help my friends out by giving them advice with their problems, and by having their back whenever they need it from supporting them in activities such as going to band concerts to being there emotionally when a break up happens.
                    I would also describe myself as a very active person. I love to play and make people laugh. For example, I enjoy playing basketball and make new friends. I would describe myself as a very intelligent, curious and wondrous person. I like to solve puzzles and question things that I am interested in or unfamiliar.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>We all know what hobbies are- you know, those fun activities we love to partake on just to distract ourselves from the stresses of life. Hobbies make us feel rejuvenated and satisfied, even when our lives are going through some disappointing phase. While others have been able to harness the power of their hobbies and converted them to money making ventures, many of us are just contented with the joy and satisfaction we derive from them.I like to play basketball, when I play I forget the problem and I feel good, I also like to eat delicious food and my favorite is penoy after playing. I also want to play online games like dota, ml, wilddrift and others.I also Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occasions. My love for music can be traced back to when I was a child. There are recorded videos of me as a child becoming hyperactive whenever music was played.</p>
